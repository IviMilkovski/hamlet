                          <h4>Prince Hamlet</h4>
                          <p>Prince Hamlet is the title role and protagonist of William Shakespeare's c. 1600 tragedy Hamlet. He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous king of Denmark. At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way. By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg. He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake).</p>
                          <p>It is also important to note that Hamlet is extremely melancholy and discontented with the state of affairs in Denmark and in his own family—indeed, in the world at large. He is extremely disappointed with his mother for marrying his uncle so quickly, and he repudiates Ophelia, a woman he once claimed to love, in the harshest terms. At a number of points in the play, he contemplates his own death and even the option of suicide.

                            But, despite all of the things with which Hamlet professes dissatisfaction, it is remarkable that the prince and heir apparent of Denmark should think about these problems only in personal and philosophical terms. He spends relatively little time thinking about the threats to Denmark’s national security from without or the threats to its stability from within.</p>

                    <h4>Horatio</h4>
                    <p>Horatio is a character in William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. Horatio's origins are unknown, although he was present on the battlefield when Hamlet's father defeated Fortinbras (the king of Norway), and attended Wittenberg University with Prince Hamlet. Horatio is evidently not directly involved in the intrigue at the Danish court; thus, he makes a good foil or sounding board for Prince Hamlet. He is often not identified as any specific court position, but simply as "Hamlet's friend".</p>
                    <p>Horatio is present through most of the major scenes of the play, but Hamlet is usually the only person to acknowledge that he is present; when other characters address him (except in I.i), they are almost always telling him to leave. He is often in scenes that are usually remembered as soliloquies, such as Hamlet's famous scene with the skull of Yorick. Horatio is also present during the mousetrap play, the discovery of Ophelia's madness (though the role of an anonymous gentleman-courtier has been substituted in this scene), Hamlet's display at Ophelia's grave, and the final scene. He is the only major character to survive the action of the play.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-9">
                        <h4>Ophelia</h4>
                        <p>Ophelia is an important character in the play Hamlet because of her femininity and because she is a means for the main character of the play, Hamlet, to act out his aggression towards his mother. Ophelia is innocent and virtuous but is looked down upon by Hamlet, who had it in his mind that women pretended to be pure and good when they really were ruled by sexual desire and sexuality. At various points in the play, Hamlet is cruel and mean to Ophelia. Following the tragic death of her father, Ophelia is driven to insanity. After a series of odd statements and behaviors, she kills herself.</p>
                        <p>When Ophelia's father Polonius wants to help King Claudius discover what is wrong with Hamlet, he asks Ophelia to use her relationship with Hamlet to find out what is Hamlet's problem. Hamlet becomes very upset by Polonius's actions and Ophelia's willingness to have her nature and sexuality used for her father's purpose.

                                Contrary to Hamlet's view of her, Ophelia is good. She is a naïve girl who wants to please both her father and her boyfriend Hamlet. She behaves innocently and is not trying to use her feminine nature to deceive or control a man as Hamlet suspected. Ophelia is loyal to her father and brother who raised her. Both her father and her brother care for her deeply and try to protect her from harm. She believes that doing what they want her to do is in her best interest. Ophelia's father Polonius and her brother Laertes do not want her in a relationship with Hamlet, since they think he wants to use Ophelia for her body and has no desire to marry her.</p>
